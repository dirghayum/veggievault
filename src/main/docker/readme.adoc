##### [Optional] If there is an old image of postgresdbimage and you want to delete it
----
$ docker image rm pgimage
----

##### To build the image
----
$ docker image build -t pgimage src/main/docker/.
----
- -t flag to give it the name of pgdb, so that it can be referenced by that name when running the container

##### To start a container from that image
----
$ docker run  --name pgdb --rm -p 5432:5432 pgimage
----
- "pgdb" is the name of container
- "pgimage" is the image from which we are running the container
- --rm flag to tell docker to delete the container when exited
- -p 5432:5432 to map container port (right) to host port (left)
- Last argument "postgres" is the command to start the database

##### Connect to datagrip
- File → New → Data Source → Postgresql
- Enter username (dmainali), password (Welcome1) and database (harvestdb) name
- URL: jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/harvestdb?currentSchema=veggieshop
- In schema tab, select `veggieshop` schema
- Apply > OK

Note:  if you cannot connect to the database, check if any instance of postgres is running on the host machine. if so you have two options:
1. change container to host port mapping like -p 5431:5432
2. or delete all instances (or stop) from host machine

##### Connect to harvestdb inside the container
- Go into the container by doing
----
$ docker exec -it pgdb bash
$ psql -U dmainali -d harvestdb
